This is a simple task management application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It allows you to create and manage tasks by separating the logic into three main components:

Model: The Task class that holds the task data.
View: The TaskView class that displays task information to the user.
Controller: The TaskController class that updates the task and communicates with the view.
Features:
Create and update tasks.
Display task information through the console.
Project Structure:
model/Task.java: Contains the task data (taskName) and provides getter and setter methods.
View/TaskView.java: Displays the task details.
controller/TaskController.java: Manages interactions between the Model and the View.
MVC_RW.java: The entry point of the application that creates the model, view, and controller, and handles the task operations.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Compile and run the MVC_RW class to see the task management in action.
