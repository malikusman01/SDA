This repository contains two implementations of a simple library system in Java, demonstrating different design approaches: one using concrete classes and the other utilizing interfaces.

Overview
Concrete Classes Implementation:

Contains separate classes for FictionBook and NonFictionBook.
A straightforward approach suitable for a small number of book types.
Interface Implementation:

Defines a Book interface that both FictionBook and NonFictionBook implement.
This design promotes flexibility and maintainability, making it easy to add new book types in the future.
Comparison Document
Included is a Word document that outlines a detailed comparison of the two implementations, highlighting their efficiency, maintainability, and performance. Code snippets from both implementations are provided for clarity.

Video Demonstration
A video demonstrating the functionality of both examples is also included in this folder. It shows how each implementation operates, along with key differences in design.
